					<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
					<p align="justify">I am a versatile individual with a background as a pianist who has explored various fields over the years. While I have a strong passion for the arts, I am equally interested in the world of business, technology, and sports. I value analytical thinking and the development of effective business strategies. I am proactive and able to collaborate effectively with others. I delivered excellent performance for several years at my previous workplace in Cluj-Napoca. Although I moved back to Szeklerland a few years ago, I continued working remotely for 3 years with the company mentioned above, which had not been an option before. This period has mostly come to an end due to distance, but I am still interested in learning, growth, challenges, and open to new opportunities.</p>

                        Although I really enjoyed my job in Miercurea Ciuc and got along well with my colleagues, my wife and I decided to move to Odorheiu Secuiesc. I was able to apply for the same position at the local art high school.

                        I worked as a sales representative with a broad range of responsibilities, including managing the website, preparing invoices, handling banking matters, communicating in Romanian, Hungarian, and English with clients and suppliers, processing orders, organizing the warehouse, leading the team, and training new employees. I was also responsible for receiving goods, checking them in, pricing, conducting inventories, preparing quotes, and setting up audio equipment. I carried out most of these tasks remotely for three years, which required effective communication and independent work.
